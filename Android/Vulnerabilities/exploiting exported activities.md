If an activity involving sensitive information is exported, it could potentially bypass authentication mechanisms, allowing unauthorized access.

Example:

```xml
<activity android:name="com.example.demo.HiddenActivity" android:exported="true">
</activity>
```

Test with adb:

```sh
adb shell am start -n com.example.demo/com.example.demo.MainActivity
```

Test with a custom android application:

```java
Intent intent = new Intent();
intent.setClassName("com.example.myapplication", "com.example.myapplication.SecondActivity");
startActivity(intent);
```
