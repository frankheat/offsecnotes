cat /etc/hostname    # Display hostname
cat /etc/hosts       # Maps IP addresses to domain (Useful to discover internal domain you can access)
cat /etc/resolv.conf # Display the domain name server (Many times it is the default gateway)
netstat -tulpn       # Display the network connections
arp -a               # Display the host ARP cache
route                # View and modify the routing table

```
